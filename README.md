# Big-Data-Storage-Processing
# Big Data Storage and Processing System

## Project Overview
A Java-based system to efficiently ingest, store, and process large volumes of real-time data. Utilizes Hadoop HDFS for distributed storage and Apache Spark for batch and streaming analytics, with APIs supporting machine learning integration.

## Features
- Real-time data ingestion from multiple IoT and other sources  
- Distributed, fault-tolerant storage using Hadoop HDFS  
- Batch and stream processing with Apache Spark  
- Secure RESTful APIs for data querying  
- Data encryption and role-based access control  
- Integration with ML models for predictive analytics  

## Technology Stack
- Java (Core Java, multi-threading, networking)  
- Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, HDFS  
- Kafka or MQTT for data ingestion  
- Spring Boot (optional) backend  
- NoSQL databases (HBase/Cassandra)  
- OAuth2/JWT for security  

## Installation and Setup
1. Install Java JDK 11 or higher  
2. Set up Hadoop and Spark clusters or use cloud services  
3. Configure data ingestion with Kafka or MQTT brokers  
4. Build the Java modules using Maven or Gradle  
5. Configure database and security settings  
6. Run the backend server and APIs  
7. Integrate machine learning modules as needed  

## Usage
- Stream data into the system using ingestion service  
- Access data and analytics via REST APIs  
- Monitor system performance using dashboards (if available)  

## Users and Roles
- System Administrator: Manage configurations and user roles  
- Data Engineers: Maintain ingestion pipelines and storage  
- Data Scientists: Query processed data for ML and analytics  
- External Clients: Securely consume data via APIs
