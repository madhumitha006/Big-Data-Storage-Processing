# Big-Data-Storage-Processing
Big Data Storage and Processing System
Project Overview
A Java-based system designed to efficiently ingest, store, and process large volumes of real-time data from IoT and other sources. Utilizes Hadoop HDFS for distributed storage and Apache Spark for batch and stream processing, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning integrations.

Features
Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources

Fault-tolerant distributed storage with Hadoop HDFS

Batch and streaming data processing using Apache Spark

Secure REST APIs for data access and querying

Data encryption and role-based access control

Integration with machine learning models for predictive analytics

Technology Stack
Java (Core Java, multi-threading, networking)

Hadoop, Spark, HDFS

Kafka or MQTT for data ingestion

Spring Boot backend (optional)

NoSQL databases like HBase or Cassandra

OAuth2/JWT for security

Installation & Setup
Install Java JDK 11+

Set up Hadoop and Spark clusters or use cloud services

Configure Kafka/MQTT ingestion

Build Java modules (Maven/Gradle)

Configure databases and security

Run backend server and APIs

Integrate ML modules as needed

Usage
Stream data using ingestion services

Query data via REST APIs

Monitor performance (optional dashboards)

Users & Roles
System Administrator

Data Engineers

Data Scientists

External API Clients
